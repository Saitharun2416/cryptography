1. Write a program for DES algorithm for decryption, the 16 keys (K1, K2, c, K16) are used
in reverse order. Design a key-generation scheme with the appropriate shift schedule for
the decryption process.

2. Write a program for encryption in the cipher block chaining (CBC) mode using an
algorithm stronger than DES. 3DES is a good candidate. Both of which follow from the
definition of CBC. Which of the two would you choose:
a. For security? b. For performance?

3. Write a program for ECB, CBC, and CFB modes, the plaintext must be a sequence of
one or more complete data blocks (or, for CFB mode, data segments). In other words, for
these three modes, the total number of bits in the plaintext must be a positive multiple of
the block (or segment) size. One common method of padding, if needed, consists of a 1
bit followed by as few zero bits, possibly none, as are necessary to complete the final
block. It is considered good practice for the sender to pad every message, including
messages in which the final message block is already complete. What is the motivation
for including a padding block when padding is not needed?

4. Write a program for Encrypt and decrypt in cipher block chaining mode using one of the
following ciphers: affine modulo 256, Hill modulo 256, S-DES, DES. Test data for S-
DES using a binary initialization vector of 1010 1010. A binary plaintext of 0000 0001
0010 0011 encrypted with a binary key of 01111 11101 should give a binary plaintext of
1111 0100 0000 1011. Decryption should work correspondingly.

5. Write a program for RSA system, the public key of a given user is e = 31, n = 3599. What
is the private key of this user? Hint: First use trial-and-error to determine p and q; then
use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the multiplicative inverse of 31 modulo f(n).

6. Write a program for Diffie-Hellman protocol, each participant selects a secret number x and
sends the other participant ax mod q for some public number a. What would happen if the
participants sent each other xa for some public number a instead? Give at least one method Alice
and Bob could use to agree on a key. Can Eve break your system without finding the secret
numbers? Can Eve find the secret numbers?
